        Iâ€™m currently a Computer Science student entering my senior year at UCF. I am passionate about promoting diversity in tech and have helped coordinate various events to support women in computing through her role as an officer at ACM-W. Other than ACM-W, I have also been actively involved on campus as a teaching assistant for Computer Science 1, and is currently involved in undergraduate research on the analysis of highly-configurable systems.\n\n

        I aspire to pursue a career in Computer Science. In the past, I have interned at Intel as an Application Developer Intern last summer and am joining Deloitte as a Solution Summer Scholar this June. In my free time, I enjoys watching baking videos and learning Japanese!\n</string>
